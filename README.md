# LLSF
LGAD laser study framework

Sensor Installation:
      1) Mount the board over the block such that it is not grounded (check resistance between 6V on the board and the block)
      2) Install the sensor, note down the channel mapping.
      3) Make sure the thermistor readings are on channel 20 of the DMM
      4) Pick one pad, find it on the oscilloscope by moving the motors, and choose the laser attenuation settings such that        you clearly see the sensor turning on and off. Note down this attenuation setting
      5) Check the photodiode signal at this attenuation setting and note down the amplitude
      6) See all the edges of the sensor to be scanned in the oscilloscope and note down the 2D position 
      7) Start the humidity logging and start the chiller
      8) Make sure the coolant from the chiller doesn't leak inside the box
      9) Now run the following labview programs:
          
         
      9) Close the box and start nitrogen
     10) Wait for humidity to stabilize (this would take at least 4 hours)
     11)
